### DESCRIPTION

This is a set of C++ macros implementing basic [software contracts](http://weblambdazero.blogspot.com/2013/09/design-by-contract.html).

### INSTALLATION

The software requires no installation, just include the "contract.hpp" file in your source code.

There is also an example application example.cpp which you can build with "make".

### USAGE

Classic design by contract uses a set of preconditions and postconditions to ensure software correctness. Take the following function as an example:

```cpp
// Calculate greatest common divisor of two integers
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    int result;

    if (b == 0) {
        result = a;
    } else {
        result = gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    return result;
}
```

According to the [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) "the greatest common divisor of two or more integers (at least one of which is not zero), is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder". To make sure that the gcd() function meets the definition we create a **contract**, which says: "if provided arguments are two integers, and at least one of them is not zero, than the result is an integer that divides both numbers without a reminder". We can divide this contract into a precodition ("provided arguments are two integers, and at least one of them is not zero") and a postcondition ("the result is an integer that divides both numbers without a reminder"), which can be written down as follows:

```cpp
// Calculate greatest common divisor of two integers
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    REQUIRES(a != 0 || b != 0) // precondition
    int result;

    if (b == 0) {
        result = a;
    } else {
        result = gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    ENSURES((a % result == 0) && (b % result == 0)) // postcondition
    return result;
}
```

Conditions within REQUIRES and ENSURES statements must evaluate to true. If they don't, it means that the contract has been broken, and a **contract::exception** is raised.

### FINAL NOTES

Make sure you don't use a combination of REQUIRES and ENSURES which are mutually dependent, for example:

```cpp
bool prime(int x)
{
    // some code here

    ENSURES(!compound(result))
    return result;
}

bool compound(int x)
{
    // some code here

    ENSURES(!prime(result))
    return result;
}
```


This will lead to cyclic execution of both functions and will result either in infinite loop or stack overflow.
